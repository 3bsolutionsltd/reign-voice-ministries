## 🙏 Biblical Encouragement

**1 Peter 4:11 (KJV)**
> "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
